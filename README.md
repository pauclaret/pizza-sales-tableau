# Pizza Restaurant Insights with Tableau üçï
This project uses Tableau to explore data from a pizza restaurant in order to uncover insights about customer behavior and pizza preferences. The data analyzed includes information about orders, such as the type of pizza ordered, the time of the order, and the price paid.

## Dataset üî¢
The dataset used for this project contains information about orders made at the pizza restaurant. The dataset includes information about each order, such as the type of pizza ordered, the time of the order, and the price paid. The data covers a period of one year.

## Visualizations üìä
Tableau was used to create visualizations that allow us to explore the dataset in order to uncover insights about customer behavior and pizza preferences.

- The first visualization is a bar chart that shows the frequency of orders by hour of the day. This allows us to see the busy times of the day for the restaurant and make informed decisions about staffing levels.

- The second visualization is a pie chart that shows the breakdown of orders by type of pizza. This chart allows us to see the most popular types of pizza and make informed decisions about menu offerings.

- The third visualization is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the price of the pizza and the time of the order. This allows us to see if there are any trends or patterns in the data.

- The fourth visualization is a word cloud that shows the ingredients used in the different types of pizza. This allows us to see the most common ingredients and make informed decisions about ingredient sourcing.

Using Tableau, the data is visualized in a way that makes it easier to understand and analyze. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore the data in depth and gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns within the data.

The goal of this project is to provide the pizza restaurant with a better understanding of customer behavior and pizza preferences. By visualizing the data in an interactive dashboard, the restaurant can make informed decisions about menu offerings, staffing levels, and ingredient sourcing.
